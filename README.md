# CCNetMC API 
A REST API providing info about people, places and more on CCNetMC. This is a "fork" of the EarthMC API, and 99% of the code is **not** written by me. Although not actually a fork, I still update from upstream when possible (I barely know any JavaScipt, and what I do know was learnt from this project). The original API was created by [Owen3H](https://github.com/Owen3H) and [Warriorrrr](https://github.com/Warriorrrr).

The original source code can be found here: [https://github.com/Owen3H/EarthMC-API](https://github.com/Owen3H/EarthMC-API)

## Basic Setup (JS Example)
1. Install a fetch package in your chosen language.
```js 
$ npm install ccnetmc
```
2. Require/import the package.
```js
var fetch = require("node-fetch")
```
3. Implement by fetching and returning the data. 
  ```js
var town = await fetch("https://shadowevil015.tech/api/v1/towns/new_amsterdam").then(res => res.json()).catch(err => { return err })

console.log(town)
// => {"name":"New_Amsterdam","nation":"Oceanic_Empire","residents":["ShootingRice","Shadowevil015","PinkyBleu"],"area":322,"mayor":"ShootingRice","capital":true,"x":18200,"z":3984,"bank":"$10,367.50","upkeep":"$320"}
```
